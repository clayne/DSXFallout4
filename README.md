Dualsense adaptive triggers for Fallout 4 on PC using external program Dual Sense X

DO NOT SELL IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE.  

I have let the code up here for hobbyists to use in other projects so that we can have dualsense adaptive trigger support for other games.
This example is in C++ and patched together from a lot of different sources.  Use the forza c# example on the discord if you do not have to use c++ (due to using 
a game mod library like f4se) as it is 100x easier.

If you run the debug plugin dll that is generated, it expects a debugger to be attached.  You can attach to the process in visual studio and it will resume running as expected.  Note, remove the steam drm with steamless from the skyrim.exe
